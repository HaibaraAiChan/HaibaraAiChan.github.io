I hold a Ph.D. in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.ucmerced.edu/) from the University of California, Merced, where I conducted extensive research in Large Language Models (LLMs), machine learning, and high-performance computing at the [PASA Lab](http://pasalabs.org). I will be graduating this May. Prior to my Ph.D., I earned an M.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Louisiana State University, an M.S. in Computer Science from the China University of Petroleum, and a B.S. degree from the Ocean University of China. My CV is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v6og7aoNTQS6ttVzpvL3wIWGaGfqyZxj/view?usp=sharing). 




<!-- My research interests span **operating systems, computer architecture, and their intersection with machine learning and high-performance computing**. My research aims to improve the performance and resource efficiency of heterogeneous computing systems while making it easier for users to deploy and manage their applications. -->
