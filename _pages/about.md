I am currently an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/). I received my Ph.D. from the University of California, Merced, from [PASA Lab](http://pasalabs.org) and received my B.S. degree from the Beijing Institute of Technology. My CV is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sf2mn118l6RwS73BNm69MNTvxPB9AIBO/view?usp=sharing). 

My research interests span **operating systems, computer architecture, and their intersection with machine learning and high-performance computing**. My research aims to improve the performance and resource efficiency of heterogeneous computing systems while making it easier for users to deploy and manage their applications.
